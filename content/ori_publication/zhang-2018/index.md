abstract: Cancer cells progressively evolve from a premalignant to a malignant state,
  which is driven by accumulating somatic alterations that confer normal cells a fitness
  advantage. Improvements in high-throughput sequencing techniques have led to an
  increase in construction of tumor phylogenetics and identification of somatic driver
  events that specifically occurred in different tumor progression stages. Here, we
  developed the SEECancer database (http://biocc.hrbmu.edu.cn/SEECancer), which aims
  to present the comprehensive cancer evolutionary stage-specific somatic events (including
  earlyspecific, late-specific, relapse-specific, metastasisspecific, drug-resistant
  and drug-induced genomic events) and their temporal orders. By manually curating
  over 10 000 published articles, 1231 evolutionary stage-specific genomic events
  and 5772 temporal orders involving 82 human cancers and 23 tissue origins were collected
  and deposited in the SEECancer database. Each entry contains the somatic event,
  evolutionary stage, cancer type, detection approach and relevant evidence. SEECancer
  provides a userfriendly interface for browsing, searching and downloading evolutionary
  stage-specific somatic events and temporal relationships in various cancers. With
  increasing attention on cancer genome evolution, the necessary information in SEECancer
  will facilitate understanding of cancer etiology and development of evolutionary
  therapeutics, and help clinicians to discover biomarkers for monitoring tumor progression.

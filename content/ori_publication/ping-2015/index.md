abstract: The driver genetic aberrations collectively regulate core cellular processes
  underlying cancer development. However, identifying the modules of driver genetic
  alterations and characterizing their functional mechanisms are still major challenges
  for cancer studies. Here, we developed an integrative multi-omics method CMDD to
  identify the driver modules and their affecting dysregulated genes through characterizing
  genetic alteration-induced dysregulated networks. Applied to glioblastoma (GBM),
  the CMDD identified a core gene module of 17 genes, including seven known GBM drivers,
  and their dysregulated genes. The module showed significant association with shorter
  survival of GBM. When classifying driver genes in the module into two gene sets
  according to their genetic alteration patterns, we found that one gene set directly
  participated in the glioma pathway, while the other indirectly regulated the glioma
  pathway, mostly, via their dysregulated genes. Both of the two gene sets were significant
  contributors to survival and helpful for classifying GBM subtypes, suggesting their
  critical roles in GBM pathogenesis. Also, by applying the CMDD to other six cancers,
  we identified some novel core modules associated with overall survival of patients.
  Together, these results demonstrate integrative multi-omics data can identify driver
  modules and uncover their dysregulated genes, which is useful for interpreting cancer
  genome.

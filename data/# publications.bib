   abstract = {The molecular regulation of human hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal and maintenance is of substantial interest, but limitations in experimental systems and interspecies variation have constrained our knowledge of this process. To better discern in vivo HSC function in humans, we have studied a rare genetic disorder due to MECOM haploinsufficiency that is characterized by neonatal aplastic anemia with an early-onset absence of HSCs in vivo.To establish a faithful model of MECOM haploinsufficiency, we performed CRISPR/Cas9 editing of MECOM in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and achieved predominantly heterozygous editing in phenotypic long-term (LT)-HSCs, as substantiated through both bulk and single cell assessments. Following MECOM editing, HSPCs showed a significant reduction in the number of phenotypic LT-HSCs as well as multipotential progenitor colonies in vitro, and had impaired engraftment following xenotransplantation into immunodeficient and Kit mutant mice. Next, we sought to use this model of MECOM haploinsufficiency to define the regulatory networks driven by MECOM that are critical for HSC maintenance. We therefore performed single-cell RNA sequencing on several thousand phenotypic LT-HSCs following MECOM editing and identified a list of 724 subtly but significantly differentially expressed genes compared to controls, including 322 genes that are downregulated after MECOM perturbation. Given the profound phenotypic effects associated with loss of MECOM and dysregulation of these gene sets, we sought to identify other cooperating factors that control the MECOM dependent gene network which underlies HSC self-renewal. To do so, we used integrative genomic approaches involving accessible chromatin and gene expression correlations, as well as long range chromatin interaction data across human hematopoiesis, to comprehensively define associations between genes and putative regulatory elements. Inspection of the nominated cis-regulatory elements controlling genes impacted by MECOM perturbation revealed significant enrichment for motifs and chromatin occupancy by several key cooperating transcription factors, including RUNX1, FLI1, and GATA2.In addition to the identification of cooperating transcription factors, we also discovered a strong binding motif enrichment for, and chromatin occupancy by, CTCF. CTCF is crucial to enable differentiation of LT-HSCs, and we found that MECOM regulated genes frequently had associated cis-regulatory elements that were occupied by CTCF. Moreover, these occupied cis-elements became more highly enriched for binding during hematopoietic differentiation. Chromatin conformation analysis revealed that the MECOM regulated genes with cis-elements bound by CTCF underwent chromatin reorganization and became more highly looped as LT-HSCs underwent differentiation, suggesting opposing functions of MECOM and CTCF in the regulation of the MECOM gene network. In light of these findings, we performed tandem perturbation of MECOM and CTCF and demonstrated rescue of LT-HSC loss with the dual perturbation, thereby illuminating a key role for MECOM in constraining CTCF-dependent chromatin reorganization that occurs as HSCs undergo differentiation.Finally, based on the observation that elevated MECOM expression is associated with high-risk myeloid malignancies, we investigated the role of the MECOM-regulated HSC gene network in acute myeloid leukemias (AML). Across three independent AML datasets, we found that the MECOM regulated gene network had an independent and strong prognostic prediction ability that enabled risk stratification beyond currently used approaches, including a variety of molecular criteria and the previously described LSC17 signature. To validate these correlative observations, we performed CRISPR/Cas9 editing of MECOM in the MUTZ-3 AML cell line that is characterized by MECOM overexpression. We found that MECOM editing results in a loss of CD34 + leukemia progenitors and that the same transcriptional network that we identified in LT-HSCs is similarly altered upon MECOM perturbation in these AML cells.Collectively, we use the study of a rare experiment of nature due to MECOM haploinsufficiency resulting in neonatal aplastic anemia to illuminate a gene regulatory network necessary for HSC self-renewal and maintenance that is co-opted in high-risk forms of AML.},

   abstract = {Background Epigenetic marks can cooperatively regulate chromatin accessibility and in turn facilitate or impede the binding of regulatory factors to various elements, suggesting their important roles in regulatory circuits. However, it remains elusive as to how epigenetic marks cooperate in the operations of regulatory network. Methods Here, we systematically characterized chromatin states of 26 epigenetic marks on different elements of protein-coding genes and miRNAs. We comprehensively analyzed, by using an integrative regulatory network, how cooperation among epigenetic, transcriptional, and post-transcriptional regulations came about. Results We observed extensive cooperation of epigenetic marks on local functional elements and complex epigenetic patterns corresponding to different biological functions. By identifying the significantly epigenetic state-modified motifs, we found that multiple combinations of epigenetic states were associated with a specific type of motif. Interestingly, miRNA-mediated motifs were linked to stable epigenetic states of downstream targets. Changes in epigenetic states of downstream targets in miRNA-mediated motifs can buffer the effects of upstream regulator on target genes, suggesting that miRNA-mediated motifs require the cooperation of epigenetic marks. Conclusions Overall, epigenetic marks are involved in the running of regulatory motifs in the way traffic lights control traffic flows and hence should be part of the architecture of complex regulatory circuits. General significance We demonstrated a detailed analysis of the cooperation of multiple epigenetic marks and how epigenetic regulation was organized into a human regulatory network. The findings form a basis for further understanding of the complicated roles of epigenetic marks on regulatory circuits.},

   abstract = {Background: DNA methylation is thought to be extensively involved in the pathogenesis of many diseases, including major psychosis. However, most studies focus on DNA methylation alteration at promoters of proteincoding genes, despite the poor correlation between DNA methylation and gene expression. Methods: We analyzed differentially methylated regions and differentially expressed genes in patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and normal subjects. Gene expression and DNA methylation were analyzed with RNA-seq and MeDIP-seq of post-mortem brain tissue (brain region BA9) cohort in five schizophrenia, seven bipolar disorder cases and six controls, respectively. Results: Here, we performed a large-scale integrative analysis using MeDIP-seq, coupled with RNA-seq, on brain samples from major psychotic and normal subjects and observed obvious discrepancy between DNA methylation and gene expression. We found that differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were distributed across different types of genomic elements, especially introns. These intronic DMRs were significantly enriched for diverse regulatory elements, such as enhancers and binding sites of certain transcriptional factors (e.g., Pol3). Notably, we found that parts of intronic DMRs overlapped with some intragenic miRNAs, such as hsa-mir-7-3. These intronic DMR-related miRNAs were found to target many differentially expressed genes. Moreover, functional analysis demonstrated that differential target genes of intronic DMR-related miRNAs were sufficient to capture many important biological processes in major psychosis, such as neurogenesis, suggesting that miRNAs may function as important linkers mediating the relationships between DNA methylation alteration and gene expression changes. Conclusions: Collectively, our study indicated that DNA methylation alteration could induce expression changes indirectly by affecting miRNAs and the exploration of DMR-related miRNAs and their targets enhanced understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying major psychosis.},

   abstract = {One of the challenging problems in drug discovery is to identify the novel targets for drugs. Most of the traditional methods for drug targets optimization focused on identifying the particular families of "druggable targets", but ignored their topological properties based on the biological pathways. In this study, we characterized the topological properties of human anticancer drug targets (ADTs) in the context of biological pathways. We found that the ADTs tended to present the following seven topological properties: influence the number of the pathways related to cancer, be localized at the start or end of the pathways, interact with cancer related genes, exhibit higher connectivity, vulnerability, betweenness, and closeness than other genes. We first ranked ADTs based on their topological property values respectively, then fused them into one global-rank using the joint cumulative distribution of an N-dimensional order statistic to optimize human ADTs. We applied the optimization method to 13 anticancer drugs, respectively. Results demonstrated that over 70% of known ADTs were ranked in the top 20%. Furthermore, the performance for mercaptopurine was significant: 6 known targets (ADSL, GMPR2, GMPR, HPRT1, AMPD3, AMPD2) were ranked in the top 15 and other four out of the top 15 (MAT2A, CDKN1A, AREG, JUN) have the potentialities to become new targets for cancer therapy.},

However, little is known about how the lincRNAs work together with protein-coding genes (PCGs) contributing to the pathogenesis of heart failure. In this study, we constructed a comprehensive transcriptome profile of lincRNAs, PCGs and miRNAs using RNA-seq and miRNA-seq data of 16 heart failure patients (HFs) and 8 non-failing individuals (NFs). Through integrating lincRNA and PCG expression profiles, we identified HF-associated lincRNA modules. We identified a heart-specific lincRNA module which was significantly enriched for differentially expressed lincRNAs and PCGs. This module was associated with heart failure rather than with other clinical traits such as sex, age, smoking and diabetes mellitus. Moreover, the module was significantly correlated with certain indicators of left ventricular function like ejection fraction and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, implying the potential of its components as crucial biomarkers. Apart from enhancer-like function, lincRNAs in this module could act as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) to regulate genes which were associated with left-ventricular systolic function. Our work provided deep insights into the critical roles of lincRNAs in the pathology of heart failure and suggested that they could be valuable biomarkers and therapeutic targets.},

   abstract = {Despite highly successful treatments for localized prostate cancer (PCa), prognostic biomarkers are needed to improve patient management and prognosis. Accumulating evidence suggests that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are key regulators with biological and clinical significance. By transcriptome analysis, we identified a set of consistently dysregulated lncRNAs in PCa across different datasets and revealed an eight-lncRNA signature that significantly associated with the biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival. Based on the signature, patients could be classified into high- and low-risk groups with significantly different survival (HR = 2.19; 95% CI = 1.67-2.88; P < 0.0001). Validations in the validation cohorts and another independent cohort confirmed its prognostic value for recurrence prediction. Multivariable analysis showed that the signature was independent of common clinicopathological features and stratified analysis further revealed its role in elevating risk stratification of current prognostic models. Additionally, the eightlncRNA signature was able to improve on the CAPRA-S score for the prediction of BCR as well as to reflect the metastatic potential of PCa. Functional characterization suggested that these lncRNAs which showed PCa-specific expression patterns may involve in critical processes in tumorigenesis. Overall, our results demonstrated potential application of lncRNAs as novel independent biomarkers. The eight-lncRNA signature may have clinical potential for facilitating further stratification of more aggressive patients who would benefit from adjuvant therapy.},

   abstract = {As the fifth base in mammalian genome, 5-methylcytosine (5 mC) is essential for many biological processes including normal development and disease. Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-seq), which uses anti-5 mC antibodies to enrich for methylated fraction of the genome, is widely used to investigate methylome at a resolution of 100-500 bp. Considering the CpG density-dependent bias and limited resolution of MeDIP-seq, we developed a Random Forest Regression (RFR) model method, MeSiC, to estimate DNA methylation levels at single-base resolution. MeSiC integrated MeDIP-seq signals of CpG sites and their surrounding neighbors as well as genomic features to construct genomic element-dependent RFR models. In the H1 cell line, a high correlation was observed between MeSiC predictions and actual 5 mC levels. Meanwhile, MeSiC enabled to calibrate CpG density-dependent bias of MeDIP-seq signals. Importantly, we found that MeSiC models constructed in the H1 cell line could be used to accurately predict DNA methylation levels for other cell types. Comparisons with methylCRF and MEDIPS showed that MeSiC achieved comparable and even better performance. These demonstrate that MeSiC can provide accurate estimations of 5 mC levels at single-CpG resolution using MeDIP-seq data alone.},

Accumulating evidence reveals that non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are closely associated with a wide variety of EDs. However, abundant associations between ncRNAs and EDs are scattered across the published literature, obstructing a global view of ncRNA-ED associations. A public resource of high-quality manually curated ncRNAomics knowledge associated with EDs remains unavailable. To address this gap, we thus developed Nc2Eye (http://nc2eye.bio-data.cn/), which is the first knowledgebase dedicated to providing a comprehensive ncRNAomics resource for bridging basic and clinical research in EDs. Through a comprehensive review of more than 2400 published papers, Nc2Eye catalogs 7088 manually curated ncRNA-ED associations involving 4363 ncRNAs across eight species. We also provide detailed descriptions and annotation information for each ncRNA-disease association such as ncRNA categories, experimental methods, expression pattern and related clinical drugs. To further expand the pathogenic ncRNAs, we also collected more than 90 high-throughput EDs-related transcriptome datasets. Furthermore, a user-friendly interface was constructed for convenient and flexible data browsing, querying, and retrieving. We believe that Nc2Eye is a timely and valuable knowledgebase for significantly improving and useful for discovery of new diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers.},

The identification of prognostic risk factors may enable effective diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. In particular, numerous gene-expression-based prognostic signatures were developed and some of them have already been applied into clinical trials and practice. In this study, we summarized several representative gene-expression-based signatures with significant prognostic value and separately assessed their ability of prognosis prediction in their originally targeted populations of breast cancer. Notably, many of the collected signatures were originally designed to predict the outcomes of estrogen receptor positive (ER+) patients or the whole breast cancer cohort; there are no typical signatures used for the prognostic prediction in a specific population of patients with the intrinsic subtype. We thus attempted to identify subtype-specific prognostic signatures via a computational framework for analyzing multi-omics profiles and patient survival. For both the discovery and an independent data set, we confirmed that subtype-specific signature is a strong and significant independent prognostic factor in the corresponding cohort. These results indicate that the subtype-specific prognostic signature has a much higher resolution in the risk stratification, which may lead to improved therapies and precision medicine for patients with breast cancer.},

Based on these transcriptome analyses, the Gene Perturbation Atlas (GPA) can be used to detect (i) novel or cell-specific functions and pathways affected by perturbed genes, (ii) protein interactions and regulatory cascades affected by perturbed genes, and (iii) perturbed gene-mediated cooperative effects. The GPA is a user-friendly database to support the rapid searching and exploration of gene perturbations. Particularly, we visualized functional effects of perturbed genes from multiple perspectives.

However, it remains difficult to determine gene paths which were sufficient to capture cancer behaviors and to broadly explain cancer mechanisms. Here, as a case study of colorectal cancer (CRC), functional and dynamic characterizations of five types of engineered organoids with different mutation combinations of five driver genes (APC, SMAD4, KRAS, TP53, and PIK3CA) showed that sequential introductions of all five driver mutations could induce enhanced activation of more hallmark signatures, tending to cancer. Comparative analysis of engineered organoids and corresponding CRC tissues revealed sequential introduction of key mutations could continually shorten the biological distance from engineered organoids to CRC tissues. Nevertheless, there still existed substantial biological gaps between the engineered organoid even with five key mutations and CRC samples. Thus, we proposed an integrative strategy to prioritize gene cascading paths for shrinking biological gaps between engineered organoids and CRC tissues. Our results not only recapitulated the well-known adenoma–carcinoma sequence model (e.g., AKST-organoid with driver mutations in APC, KRAS, SMAD4, and TP53), but also provided potential paths for delineating alternative pathogenesis underlying CRC populations (e.g., A-organoid with APC mutation). Our strategy also can be applied to both organoids with more mutations and other cancers, which can improve and innovate mechanism across cancer patients for drug design and cancer therapy.},

To investigate how chromatin states associated with network motifs, we assembled chromatin state-modified regulatory networks by combining 269 ChIP-seq data and chromatin states in four cell types. We found that many chromatin states were significantly associated with network motifs, especially for feedforward loops (FFLs). These distinct chromatin state compositions contribute to different expression levels and translational control of targets in FFLs. Strikingly, the chromatin state-modified FFLs were highly cell-specific and, to a large extent, determined cell-selective functions, such as the embryonic stem cell-specific bivalent modification-related FFL with an important role in poising developmentally important genes for expression. Besides, comparisons of chromatin state-modified FFLs between cancerous/stem and primary cell lines revealed specific type of chromatin state alterations that may act together with motif structural changes cooperatively contribute to cell-to-cell functional differences. Combination of these alterations could be helpful in prioritizing candidate genes.

Many sex differences that affect the cancer risk were thought to be associated with cancer evolution. Methods In this study, we used an integrated framework to infer the timing and clonal status of mutations in ∼600 diffuse gliomas from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) including glioblastomas (GBMs) and low-grade gliomas (LGGs), and investigated the sex difference of mutation clonality. Results We observed higher overall and subclonal mutation burden in female patients with different grades of gliomas, which could be largely explained by the mutations of the X chromosome. Some well-established drivers were identified showing sex-biased clonality, such as CDH18 and ATRX. Focusing on glioma subtypes, we further found a higher subclonal mutation burden in females than males in the majority of glioma subtypes, and observed opposite clonal tendency of several drivers between male and female patients in a specific subtype. Moreover, analysis of clinically actionable genes revealed that mutations in genes of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway were more likely to be clonal in female patients with GBM, whereas mutations in genes involved in the receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathway were more likely to be clonal in male patients with LGG. Conclusions The patients with diffuse glioma showed sex-biased mutation clonality (eg, different subclonal mutation number and different clonal tendency of cancer genes), highlighting the need to consider sex as an important variable for improving glioma therapy and clinical care.},

However, identifying the modules of driver genetic alterations and characterizing their functional mechanisms are still major challenges for cancer studies. Here, we developed an integrative multi-omics method CMDD to identify the driver modules and their affecting dysregulated genes through characterizing genetic alteration-induced dysregulated networks. Applied to glioblastoma (GBM), the CMDD identified a core gene module of 17 genes, including seven known GBM drivers, and their dysregulated genes. The module showed significant association with shorter survival of GBM. When classifying driver genes in the module into two gene sets according to their genetic alteration patterns, we found that one gene set directly participated in the glioma pathway, while the other indirectly regulated the glioma pathway, mostly, via their dysregulated genes. Both of the two gene sets were significant contributors to survival and helpful for classifying GBM subtypes, suggesting their critical roles in GBM pathogenesis. Also, by applying the CMDD to other six cancers, we identified some novel core modules associated with overall survival of patients. Together, these results demonstrate integrative multi-omics data can identify driver modules and uncover their dysregulated genes, which is useful for interpreting cancer genome.},

   abstract = {While genome-wide differential DNA methylation regions (DMRs) have been extensively identified, the comprehensive prioritization of their functional importance is still poorly explored. Here, we aggregated multiple data resources rooted in the genome, epigenome and transcriptome to systematically prioritize functional DMRs (fDMRs) in colorectal cancer (CRC). As demonstrated, the top-ranked fDMRs from all of the data resources showed a strong enrichment for known methylated genes. Additionally, we analyzed those top 5% DMR-coupled coding genes using functional enrichment, which resulted in significant disease-related biological functions in contrast to the tail 5% genes. To further confirm the functional importance of the top-ranked fDMRs, we applied chromatin modification alterations of CRC cell lines to characterize their functional regulation. Specifically, we extended the utility of the top-ranked DMR-coupled genes to serve as classification and survival biomarkers, which showed a robust performance across diverse independent data sets. Collectively, our results established an integrative framework to prioritize fDMRs, which could help characterize aberrant DNA methylation-induced potential mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis and uncover epigenome-based biomarkers for clinical diagnosis and prognosis.},

   abstract = {Genome-wide association studies in combination with single-cell genomic atlases can provide insights into the mechanisms of disease-causal genetic variation. However, identification of disease-relevant or trait-relevant cell types, states and trajectories is often hampered by sparsity and noise, particularly in the analysis of single-cell epigenomic data. To overcome these challenges, we present SCAVENGE, a computational algorithm that uses network propagation to map causal variants to their relevant cellular context at single-cell resolution. We demonstrate how SCAVENGE can help identify key biological mechanisms underlying human genetic variation, applying the method to blood traits at distinct stages of human hematopoiesis, to monocyte subsets that increase the risk for severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to intermediate lymphocyte developmental states that predispose to acute leukemia. Our approach not only provides a framework for enabling variant-to-function insights at single-cell resolution but also suggests a more general strategy for maximizing the inferences that can be made using single-cell genomic data.},

   abstract = {Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to play key roles in various biological processes. However, functions of most lncRNAs are poorly characterized. Here, we represent a framework to predict functions of lncRNAs through construction of a regulatory network between lncRNAs and protein-coding genes. Using RNA-seq data, the transcript profiles of lncRNAs and protein-coding genes are constructed. Using the Bayesian network method, a regulatory network, which implies dependency relations between lncRNAs and protein-coding genes, was built. In combining protein interaction network, highly connected coding genes linked by a given lncRNA were subsequently used to predict functions of the lncRNA through functional enrichment. Application of our method to prostate RNA-seq data showed that 762 lncRNAs in the constructed regulatory network were assigned functions. We found that lncRNAs are involved in diverse biological processes, such as tissue development or embryo development (e.g., nervous system development and mesoderm development). By comparison with functions inferred using the neighboring gene-based method and functions determined using lncRNA knockdown experiments, our method can provide comparable predicted functions of lncRNAs. Overall, our method can be applied to emerging RNA-seq data, which will help researchers identify complex relations between lncRNAs and coding genes and reveal important functions of lncRNAs.},

   abstract = {Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as a class of important regulators participating in various biological functions and disease processes. With the widespread application of next-generation sequencing technologies, large numbers of lncRNAs have been identified, producing plenty of lncRNA annotation resources in different contexts. However, at present, we lack a comprehensive overview of these lncRNA annotation resources. In this study, we reviewed 24 currently available lncRNA annotation resources referring to > 205 000 lncRNAs in over 50 tissues and cell lines. We characterized these annotation resources from different aspects, including exon structure, expression, histone modification and function.We found many distinct properties among these annotation resources. Especially, these resources showed diverse chromatin signatures, remarkable tissue and cell type dependence and functional specificity. Our results suggested the incompleteness and complementarity of current lncRNA annotations and the necessity of integration of multiple resources to comprehensively characterize lncRNAs. Finally, we developed 'LNCat' (lncRNA atlas, freely available at http://biocc.hrbmu.edu.cn/LNCat/), a user-friendly database that provides a genome browser of lncRNA structures, visualization of different resources from multiple angles and download of different combinations of lncRNA annotations, and supports rapid exploration, comparison and integration of lncRNA annotation resources. Overall, our study provides a comprehensive comparison of numerous lncRNA annotations, and can facilitate understanding of lncRNAs in human disease.},

   abstract = {Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) constitute an important layer of chromatin regulation that contributes to various biological processes and diseases. By interacting with chromatin, many lncRNAs can regulate that state of chromatin by recruiting chromatin-modifying complexes and thus control large-scale gene expression programs. However, the available information on interactions between lncRNAs and chromatin is hidden in a large amount of dispersed literature and has not been extensively collected. We established the LnChrom database, a manually curated resource of experimentally validated lncRNA-chromatin interactions. The current release of LnChrom includes 382 743 interactions in human and mouse. We also manually collected detailed metadata for each interaction pair, including those of chromatin modifying factors, epigenetic marks and disease associations. LnChrom provides a user-friendly interface to facilitate browsing, searching and retrieving of lncRNA-chromatin interaction data. Additionally, a large amount of multi-omics data was integrated into LnChrom to aid in characterizing the effects of lncRNA-chromatin interactions on epigenetic modifications and transcriptional expression. We believe that LnChrom is a timely and valuable resource that can greatly motivate mechanistic research into lncRNAs.},

Biological pathways in distinct cell types have different activation patterns, which facilitates the understanding of cell functions using single-cell transcriptomics. However, no effective web tool has been implemented for single-cell transcriptome data analysis based on prior biological pathway knowledge. Results: Here, we present scTPA, a web-based platform for pathway-based analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data in human and mouse. scTPA incorporates four widely-used gene set enrichment methods to estimate the pathway activation scores of single cells based on a collection of available biological pathways with different functional and taxonomic classifications. The clustering analysis and cell-type-specific activation pathway identification were provided for the functional interpretation of cell types from a pathway-oriented perspective. An intuitive interface allows users to conveniently visualize and download single-cell pathway signatures. Overall, scTPA is a comprehensive tool for the identification of pathway activation signatures for the analysis of single cell heterogeneity.},

   abstract = {Retinoblastoma (Rb) is the most prevalent intraocular malignancy in children, with a worldwide survival rate <30%. We have developed a cancerous model of Rb in retinal organoids derived from genetically engineered human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) with a biallelic mutagenesis of the RB1 gene. These organoid Rbs exhibit properties highly consistent with Rb tumorigenesis, transcriptome, and genome-wide methylation. Single-cell sequencing analysis suggests that Rb originated from ARR3-positive maturing cone precursors during development, which was further validated by immunostaining. Notably, we found that the PI3K-Akt pathway was aberrantly deregulated and its activator spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) was significantly up-regulated. In addition, SYK inhibitors led to remarkable cell apoptosis in cancerous organoids. In conclusion, we have established an organoid Rb model derived from genetically engineered hESCs in a dish that has enabled us to trace the cell of origin and to test novel candidate therapeutic agents for human Rb, shedding light on the development and therapeutics of other malignancies.},

We also manually curated related biological and clinical information for each profile, allowing users to better browse and compare cfDNA epigenomes at a specific stage (such as early-or metastasis-stage) of cancer development.

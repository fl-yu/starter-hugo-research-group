 abstract = {Background Epigenetic marks can cooperatively regulate chromatin accessibility and in turn facilitate or impede the binding of regulatory factors to various elements, suggesting their important roles in regulatory circuits. However, it remains elusive as to how epigenetic marks cooperate in the operations of regulatory network. Methods Here, we systematically characterized chromatin states of 26 epigenetic marks on different elements of protein-coding genes and miRNAs. We comprehensively analyzed, by using an integrative regulatory network, how cooperation among epigenetic, transcriptional, and post-transcriptional regulations came about. Results We observed extensive cooperation of epigenetic marks on local functional elements and complex epigenetic patterns corresponding to different biological functions. By identifying the significantly epigenetic state-modified motifs, we found that multiple combinations of epigenetic states were associated with a specific type of motif. Interestingly, miRNA-mediated motifs were linked to stable epigenetic states of downstream targets. Changes in epigenetic states of downstream targets in miRNA-mediated motifs can buffer the effects of upstream regulator on target genes, suggesting that miRNA-mediated motifs require the cooperation of epigenetic marks. Conclusions Overall, epigenetic marks are involved in the running of regulatory motifs in the way traffic lights control traffic flows and hence should be part of the architecture of complex regulatory circuits. General significance We demonstrated a detailed analysis of the cooperation of multiple epigenetic marks and how epigenetic regulation was organized into a human regulatory network. The findings form a basis for further understanding of the complicated roles of epigenetic marks on regulatory circuits.},

abstract: Background Epigenetic marks can cooperatively regulate chromatin accessibility
  and in turn facilitate or impede the binding of regulatory factors to various elements,
  suggesting their important roles in regulatory circuits. However, it remains elusive
  as to how epigenetic marks cooperate in the operations of regulatory network. Methods
  Here, we systematically characterized chromatin states of 26 epigenetic marks on
  different elements of protein-coding genes and miRNAs. We comprehensively analyzed,
  by using an integrative regulatory network, how cooperation among epigenetic, transcriptional,
  and post-transcriptional regulations came about. Results We observed extensive cooperation
  of epigenetic marks on local functional elements and complex epigenetic patterns
  corresponding to different biological functions. By identifying the significantly
  epigenetic state-modified motifs, we found that multiple combinations of epigenetic
  states were associated with a specific type of motif. Interestingly, miRNA-mediated
  motifs were linked to stable epigenetic states of downstream targets. Changes in
  epigenetic states of downstream targets in miRNA-mediated motifs can buffer the
  effects of upstream regulator on target genes, suggesting that miRNA-mediated motifs
  require the cooperation of epigenetic marks. Conclusions Overall, epigenetic marks
  are involved in the running of regulatory motifs in the way traffic lights control
  traffic flows and hence should be part of the architecture of complex regulatory
  circuits. General significance We demonstrated a detailed analysis of the cooperation
  of multiple epigenetic marks and how epigenetic regulation was organized into a
  human regulatory network. The findings form a basis for further understanding of
  the complicated roles of epigenetic marks on regulatory circuits.

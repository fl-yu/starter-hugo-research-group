abstract: Long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) are emerging as important regulatory
  molecules involved in diseases including heart failure. However, little is known
  about how the lincRNAs work together with protein-coding genes (PCGs) contributing
  to the pathogenesis of heart failure. In this study, we constructed a comprehensive
  transcriptome profile of lincRNAs, PCGs and miRNAs using RNA-seq and miRNA-seq data
  of 16 heart failure patients (HFs) and 8 non-failing individuals (NFs). Through
  integrating lincRNA and PCG expression profiles, we identified HF-associated lincRNA
  modules. We identified a heart-specific lincRNA module which was significantly enriched
  for differentially expressed lincRNAs and PCGs. This module was associated with
  heart failure rather than with other clinical traits such as sex, age, smoking and
  diabetes mellitus. Moreover, the module was significantly correlated with certain
  indicators of left ventricular function like ejection fraction and left ventricular
  end-diastolic diameter, implying the potential of its components as crucial biomarkers.
  Apart from enhancer-like function, lincRNAs in this module could act as competing
  endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) to regulate genes which were associated with left-ventricular
  systolic function. Our work provided deep insights into the critical roles of lincRNAs
  in the pathology of heart failure and suggested that they could be valuable biomarkers
  and therapeutic targets.

I’m a Postdocteral Research Scientist at Harvard Medical School. My research interests are mainly in bioinformatics, single-cell genomics, deep learning, and human (epi)genetics.

I completed my Ph.D. of Bioinformatics from Harbin Medical University (2018). In early 2020, I joined in Guocheng Yuan lab at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Vijay Sankaran lab at Boston Children’s Hospital/Broad Institute as a research fellow, repectively, where I worked on algorithm and tool development in terms of single-cell genomics and human genetics.

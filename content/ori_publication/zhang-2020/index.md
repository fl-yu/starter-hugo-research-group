abstract: 'Motivation: At present, a fundamental challenge in single-cell RNA-sequencing
  data analysis is functional interpretation and annotation of cell clusters. Biological
  pathways in distinct cell types have different activation patterns, which facilitates
  the understanding of cell functions using single-cell transcriptomics. However,
  no effective web tool has been implemented for single-cell transcriptome data analysis
  based on prior biological pathway knowledge. Results: Here, we present scTPA, a
  web-based platform for pathway-based analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data in human
  and mouse. scTPA incorporates four widely-used gene set enrichment methods to estimate
  the pathway activation scores of single cells based on a collection of available
  biological pathways with different functional and taxonomic classifications. The
  clustering analysis and cell-type-specific activation pathway identification were
  provided for the functional interpretation of cell types from a pathway-oriented
  perspective. An intuitive interface allows users to conveniently visualize and download
  single-cell pathway signatures. Overall, scTPA is a comprehensive tool for the identification
  of pathway activation signatures for the analysis of single cell heterogeneity.'

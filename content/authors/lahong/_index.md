Lahong Xu received her Ph.D. from Texas A&M University in USA, where she conducted research in single-cell transcriptomics and plant innate immunity. Currently, Dr. Xu's research interests lie in the integration of scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq data. She is focused on developing computational models that leverage the power of both sequencing techniques to predict chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq) from gene expression data (scRNA-seq). Her approach aims to bridge the gap between transcriptional activity and chromatin state, providing deeper insights into cellular regulation and identity.

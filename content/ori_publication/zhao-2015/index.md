abstract: Epigenetic modification can affect many important biological processes,
  such as cell proliferation and apoptosis. It can alter chromatin conformation and
  contribute to gene regulation. To investigate how chromatin states associated with
  network motifs, we assembled chromatin state-modified regulatory networks by combining
  269 ChIP-seq data and chromatin states in four cell types. We found that many chromatin
  states were significantly associated with network motifs, especially for feedforward
  loops (FFLs). These distinct chromatin state compositions contribute to different
  expression levels and translational control of targets in FFLs. Strikingly, the
  chromatin state-modified FFLs were highly cell-specific and, to a large extent,
  determined cell-selective functions, such as the embryonic stem cell-specific bivalent
  modification-related FFL with an important role in poising developmentally important
  genes for expression. Besides, comparisons of chromatin state-modified FFLs between
  cancerous/stem and primary cell lines revealed specific type of chromatin state
  alterations that may act together with motif structural changes cooperatively contribute
  to cell-to-cell functional differences. Combination of these alterations could be
  helpful in prioritizing candidate genes. Together, this work highlights that a dynamic
  epigenetic dimension can help network motifs to control cell-specific functions.

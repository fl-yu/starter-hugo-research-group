abstract: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) constitute an important layer of chromatin
  regulation that contributes to various biological processes and diseases. By interacting
  with chromatin, many lncRNAs can regulate that state of chromatin by recruiting
  chromatin-modifying complexes and thus control large-scale gene expression programs.
  However, the available information on interactions between lncRNAs and chromatin
  is hidden in a large amount of dispersed literature and has not been extensively
  collected. We established the LnChrom database, a manually curated resource of experimentally
  validated lncRNA-chromatin interactions. The current release of LnChrom includes
  382 743 interactions in human and mouse. We also manually collected detailed metadata
  for each interaction pair, including those of chromatin modifying factors, epigenetic
  marks and disease associations. LnChrom provides a user-friendly interface to facilitate
  browsing, searching and retrieving of lncRNA-chromatin interaction data. Additionally,
  a large amount of multi-omics data was integrated into LnChrom to aid in characterizing
  the effects of lncRNA-chromatin interactions on epigenetic modifications and transcriptional
  expression. We believe that LnChrom is a timely and valuable resource that can greatly
  motivate mechanistic research into lncRNAs.

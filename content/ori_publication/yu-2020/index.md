abstract: Epigenetic alterations, including 5-methylcytosine (5mC), 5-hydroxymethylcytosine
  (5hmC) and nucleosome positioning (NP), in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) have been widely
  observed in human diseases, and many available cfDNA-based epigenome-wide profiles
  exhibit high sensitivity and specificity in disease detection and classification.
  However, due to the lack of efficient collection, standardized quality control,
  and analysis procedures, efficiently integrating and reusing these data remain considerable
  challenges. Here, we introduce CFEA (http://www.bio-data.cn/CFEA), a cell-free epigenome
  database dedicated to three types of widely adopted epigenetic modifications (5mC,
  5hmC and NP) involved in 27 human diseases. We developed bioinformatic pipelines
  for quality control and standard data processing and an easy-to-use web interface
  to facilitate the query, visualization and download of these cell-free epigenome
  data. We also manually curated related biological and clinical information for each
  profile, allowing users to better browse and compare cfDNA epigenomes at a specific
  stage (such as early-or metastasis-stage) of cancer development. CFEA provides a
  comprehensive and timely resource to the scientific community and supports the development
  of liquid biopsy-based biomarkers for various human diseases.

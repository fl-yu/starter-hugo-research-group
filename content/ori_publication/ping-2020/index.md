abstract: Engineered organoids by sequential introduction of key mutations could help
  modeling the dynamic cancer progression. However, it remains difficult to determine
  gene paths which were sufficient to capture cancer behaviors and to broadly explain
  cancer mechanisms. Here, as a case study of colorectal cancer (CRC), functional
  and dynamic characterizations of five types of engineered organoids with different
  mutation combinations of five driver genes (APC, SMAD4, KRAS, TP53, and PIK3CA)
  showed that sequential introductions of all five driver mutations could induce enhanced
  activation of more hallmark signatures, tending to cancer. Comparative analysis
  of engineered organoids and corresponding CRC tissues revealed sequential introduction
  of key mutations could continually shorten the biological distance from engineered
  organoids to CRC tissues. Nevertheless, there still existed substantial biological
  gaps between the engineered organoid even with five key mutations and CRC samples.
  Thus, we proposed an integrative strategy to prioritize gene cascading paths for
  shrinking biological gaps between engineered organoids and CRC tissues. Our results
  not only recapitulated the well-known adenomaâ€“carcinoma sequence model (e.g., AKST-organoid
  with driver mutations in APC, KRAS, SMAD4, and TP53), but also provided potential
  paths for delineating alternative pathogenesis underlying CRC populations (e.g.,
  A-organoid with APC mutation). Our strategy also can be applied to both organoids
  with more mutations and other cancers, which can improve and innovate mechanism
  across cancer patients for drug design and cancer therapy.

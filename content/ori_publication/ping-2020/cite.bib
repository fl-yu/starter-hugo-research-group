 abstract = {Engineered organoids by sequential introduction of key mutations could help modeling the dynamic cancer progression. However, it remains difficult to determine gene paths which were sufficient to capture cancer behaviors and to broadly explain cancer mechanisms. Here, as a case study of colorectal cancer (CRC), functional and dynamic characterizations of five types of engineered organoids with different mutation combinations of five driver genes (APC, SMAD4, KRAS, TP53, and PIK3CA) showed that sequential introductions of all five driver mutations could induce enhanced activation of more hallmark signatures, tending to cancer. Comparative analysis of engineered organoids and corresponding CRC tissues revealed sequential introduction of key mutations could continually shorten the biological distance from engineered organoids to CRC tissues. Nevertheless, there still existed substantial biological gaps between the engineered organoid even with five key mutations and CRC samples. Thus, we proposed an integrative strategy to prioritize gene cascading paths for shrinking biological gaps between engineered organoids and CRC tissues. Our results not only recapitulated the well-known adenomaâ€“carcinoma sequence model (e.g., AKST-organoid with driver mutations in APC, KRAS, SMAD4, and TP53), but also provided potential paths for delineating alternative pathogenesis underlying CRC populations (e.g., A-organoid with APC mutation). Our strategy also can be applied to both organoids with more mutations and other cancers, which can improve and innovate mechanism across cancer patients for drug design and cancer therapy.},

abstract: Breast cancer is a very complex and heterogeneous disease with variable
  molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis and clinical behaviors. The identification
  of prognostic risk factors may enable effective diagnosis and treatment of breast
  cancer. In particular, numerous gene-expression-based prognostic signatures were
  developed and some of them have already been applied into clinical trials and practice.
  In this study, we summarized several representative gene-expression-based signatures
  with significant prognostic value and separately assessed their ability of prognosis
  prediction in their originally targeted populations of breast cancer. Notably, many
  of the collected signatures were originally designed to predict the outcomes of
  estrogen receptor positive (ER+) patients or the whole breast cancer cohort; there
  are no typical signatures used for the prognostic prediction in a specific population
  of patients with the intrinsic subtype. We thus attempted to identify subtype-specific
  prognostic signatures via a computational framework for analyzing multi-omics profiles
  and patient survival. For both the discovery and an independent data set, we confirmed
  that subtype-specific signature is a strong and significant independent prognostic
  factor in the corresponding cohort. These results indicate that the subtype-specific
  prognostic signature has a much higher resolution in the risk stratification, which
  may lead to improved therapies and precision medicine for patients with breast cancer.

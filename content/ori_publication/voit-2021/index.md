abstract: The molecular regulation of human hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal
  and maintenance is of substantial interest, but limitations in experimental systems
  and interspecies variation have constrained our knowledge of this process. To better
  discern in vivo HSC function in humans, we have studied a rare genetic disorder
  due to MECOM haploinsufficiency that is characterized by neonatal aplastic anemia
  with an early-onset absence of HSCs in vivo.To establish a faithful model of MECOM
  haploinsufficiency, we performed CRISPR/Cas9 editing of MECOM in human hematopoietic
  stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and achieved predominantly heterozygous editing
  in phenotypic long-term (LT)-HSCs, as substantiated through both bulk and single
  cell assessments. Following MECOM editing, HSPCs showed a significant reduction
  in the number of phenotypic LT-HSCs as well as multipotential progenitor colonies
  in vitro, and had impaired engraftment following xenotransplantation into immunodeficient
  and Kit mutant mice. Next, we sought to use this model of MECOM haploinsufficiency
  to define the regulatory networks driven by MECOM that are critical for HSC maintenance.
  We therefore performed single-cell RNA sequencing on several thousand phenotypic
  LT-HSCs following MECOM editing and identified a list of 724 subtly but significantly
  differentially expressed genes compared to controls, including 322 genes that are
  downregulated after MECOM perturbation. Given the profound phenotypic effects associated
  with loss of MECOM and dysregulation of these gene sets, we sought to identify other
  cooperating factors that control the MECOM dependent gene network which underlies
  HSC self-renewal. To do so, we used integrative genomic approaches involving accessible
  chromatin and gene expression correlations, as well as long range chromatin interaction
  data across human hematopoiesis, to comprehensively define associations between
  genes and putative regulatory elements. Inspection of the nominated cis-regulatory
  elements controlling genes impacted by MECOM perturbation revealed significant enrichment
  for motifs and chromatin occupancy by several key cooperating transcription factors,
  including RUNX1, FLI1, and GATA2.In addition to the identification of cooperating
  transcription factors, we also discovered a strong binding motif enrichment for,
  and chromatin occupancy by, CTCF. CTCF is crucial to enable differentiation of LT-HSCs,
  and we found that MECOM regulated genes frequently had associated cis-regulatory
  elements that were occupied by CTCF. Moreover, these occupied cis-elements became
  more highly enriched for binding during hematopoietic differentiation. Chromatin
  conformation analysis revealed that the MECOM regulated genes with cis-elements
  bound by CTCF underwent chromatin reorganization and became more highly looped as
  LT-HSCs underwent differentiation, suggesting opposing functions of MECOM and CTCF
  in the regulation of the MECOM gene network. In light of these findings, we performed
  tandem perturbation of MECOM and CTCF and demonstrated rescue of LT-HSC loss with
  the dual perturbation, thereby illuminating a key role for MECOM in constraining
  CTCF-dependent chromatin reorganization that occurs as HSCs undergo differentiation.Finally,
  based on the observation that elevated MECOM expression is associated with high-risk
  myeloid malignancies, we investigated the role of the MECOM-regulated HSC gene network
  in acute myeloid leukemias (AML). Across three independent AML datasets, we found
  that the MECOM regulated gene network had an independent and strong prognostic prediction
  ability that enabled risk stratification beyond currently used approaches, including
  a variety of molecular criteria and the previously described LSC17 signature. To
  validate these correlative observations, we performed CRISPR/Cas9 editing of MECOM
  in the MUTZ-3 AML cell line that is characterized by MECOM overexpression. We found
  that MECOM editing results in a loss of CD34 + leukemia progenitors and that the
  same transcriptional network that we identified in LT-HSCs is similarly altered
  upon MECOM perturbation in these AML cells.Collectively, we use the study of a rare
  experiment of nature due to MECOM haploinsufficiency resulting in neonatal aplastic
  anemia to illuminate a gene regulatory network necessary for HSC self-renewal and
  maintenance that is co-opted in high-risk forms of AML.

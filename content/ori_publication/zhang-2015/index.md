abstract: 'One of the challenging problems in drug discovery is to identify the novel
  targets for drugs. Most of the traditional methods for drug targets optimization
  focused on identifying the particular families of \"druggable targets\", but ignored
  their topological properties based on the biological pathways. In this study, we
  characterized the topological properties of human anticancer drug targets (ADTs)
  in the context of biological pathways. We found that the ADTs tended to present
  the following seven topological properties: influence the number of the pathways
  related to cancer, be localized at the start or end of the pathways, interact with
  cancer related genes, exhibit higher connectivity, vulnerability, betweenness, and
  closeness than other genes. We first ranked ADTs based on their topological property
  values respectively, then fused them into one global-rank using the joint cumulative
  distribution of an N-dimensional order statistic to optimize human ADTs. We applied
  the optimization method to 13 anticancer drugs, respectively. Results demonstrated
  that over 70% of known ADTs were ranked in the top 20%. Furthermore, the performance
  for mercaptopurine was significant: 6 known targets (ADSL, GMPR2, GMPR, HPRT1, AMPD3,
  AMPD2) were ranked in the top 15 and other four out of the top 15 (MAT2A, CDKN1A,
  AREG, JUN) have the potentialities to become new targets for cancer therapy.'

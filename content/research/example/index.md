Slides can be added in a few ways:

- **Create** slides using Wowchemy's [_Slides_](https://wowchemy.com/docs/managing-content/#create-slides) feature and link using `slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://wowchemy.com/docs/writing-markdown-latex/).

# Our research interests
The long-term goals of our lab:
1. Developing computational methods and tools to overcome the challenges of analyzing, integrating, and interpreting a variety of genomics data. 
2. With close collaboration with experimental biologists, we will be committed to uncovering the fundamental principles in gene regulatory mechanisms and eventually developing effective treatments for various human diseases.

Our current research will primarily focus on the intersections of population genetics, single cell genomics, and machine learning areas. 

- Functional interpretation of genetic causal variants at different levels including individual genomic loci, cellular context, target genes, and programs.   
- Dissect the fine-grained regulatory circuits and how they are perturbed in different diseases 
- Machine learning models for disease diagnosis, risk prediction, and the development of new therapies

 abstract = {Motivation: At present, a fundamental challenge in single-cell RNA-sequencing data analysis is functional interpretation and annotation of cell clusters. Biological pathways in distinct cell types have different activation patterns, which facilitates the understanding of cell functions using single-cell transcriptomics. However, no effective web tool has been implemented for single-cell transcriptome data analysis based on prior biological pathway knowledge. Results: Here, we present scTPA, a web-based platform for pathway-based analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data in human and mouse. scTPA incorporates four widely-used gene set enrichment methods to estimate the pathway activation scores of single cells based on a collection of available biological pathways with different functional and taxonomic classifications. The clustering analysis and cell-type-specific activation pathway identification were provided for the functional interpretation of cell types from a pathway-oriented perspective. An intuitive interface allows users to conveniently visualize and download single-cell pathway signatures. Overall, scTPA is a comprehensive tool for the identification of pathway activation signatures for the analysis of single cell heterogeneity.},

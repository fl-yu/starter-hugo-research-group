abstract: Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a degenerative disease of the central nervous
  system, is the most common form of dementia in old age. The complexity and behavior
  of circular RNA (circRNA)-associated competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network remained
  poorly characterized in AD. The aim of this study was to elucidate the regulatory
  networks of dysregulated circRNAs from ceRNA view and identify potential risk circRNAs
  involved in AD pathogenesis. Consistent differentially expressed genes (CDEGs) were
  obtained using meta-analysis for multiple microarrays, and differentially expressed
  miRNAs (DEmiRs) were identified using empirical Bayes method. The circRNA-associated
  ceRNA network (cirCeNET) was constructed based on “ceRNA hypothesis” using an integrated
  system biology method. A total of 1,872 CDEGs and 48 DEmiRs were screened across
  different datasets. By mapping CDEGs and DEmiRs into the cirCeNET, an AD-related
  circRNA-associated ceRNA network (ADcirCeNET) was constructed, including 3,907 edges
  and 1,407 nodes (276 circRNAs, 14 miRNAs and 1,117 mRNAs). By prioritizing AD risk
  circRNA-associated ceRNAs, we found that the circRNA KIAA1586 occurred most frequently
  in the AD risk circRNA-associated ceRNAs and function as a ceRNA that operates by
  competitively binding three known AD-risk miRNAs. In silico functional analysis
  suggested that circRNA KIAA1586-related ceRNA network was significantly enriched
  in known AD-associated biological processes. Our study provided a global view and
  systematic dissection of circRNA-associated ceRNA network. The identified circRNA
  KIAA1586 may be a key risk factor involved in AD pathogenesis.

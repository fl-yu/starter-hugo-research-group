abstract: Retinoblastoma (Rb) is the most prevalent intraocular malignancy in children,
  with a worldwide survival rate <30%. We have developed a cancerous model of Rb in
  retinal organoids derived from genetically engineered human embryonic stem cells
  (hESCs) with a biallelic mutagenesis of the RB1 gene. These organoid Rbs exhibit
  properties highly consistent with Rb tumorigenesis, transcriptome, and genome-wide
  methylation. Single-cell sequencing analysis suggests that Rb originated from ARR3-positive
  maturing cone precursors during development, which was further validated by immunostaining.
  Notably, we found that the PI3K-Akt pathway was aberrantly deregulated and its activator
  spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) was significantly up-regulated. In addition, SYK inhibitors
  led to remarkable cell apoptosis in cancerous organoids. In conclusion, we have
  established an organoid Rb model derived from genetically engineered hESCs in a
  dish that has enabled us to trace the cell of origin and to test novel candidate
  therapeutic agents for human Rb, shedding light on the development and therapeutics
  of other malignancies.

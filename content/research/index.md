# Our research interests
Our lab will primarliy work on the intersections of population genetics, single cell genomics and meachine learning. 
- Functional interpreation of genetic variants  
Although the scale of this challenge is daunting, better methods for functional variant interpretation will have transformative consequences for disease diagnosis, risk prediction, and the development of new therapies. 
dissect variant mechanisms across a range of human cell types and environments.
These approaches are also increasingly being deployed in clinical settings

- Fine-grained regulatory circuits inference using single cell genomics 


- Machine learning for cancer genomics
